# Changelog

All notable changes to `@nivoda/components` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Atomic design folder structure (`atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`) per CONTRIBUTING.md §"Folder structure". All 50 components moved into `components/<layer>/<name>/` folders with per-component Storybook story and `COMPONENT.md` stub.
- One base Storybook story (`Default`) per component, with sidebar category from CONTRIBUTING.md §"Sidebar taxonomy".
- `COMPONENT.md` skeleton per component with frontmatter (`status: unstable`, `version: 0.0.0`) and `[WIP]` section bodies.
- Testing infrastructure: `vitest@^3`, `@storybook/experimental-addon-test@8.6.18`, `@storybook/addon-a11y@8.6.18`, `@storybook/test@8.6.18`, `@vitest/browser@^3`, `playwright@^1`. `vitest.config.ts` runs every story as a render test via the experimental-addon-test vitest plugin in headless Chromium. `.storybook/vitest.setup.ts` wires Storybook preview annotations into the test environment. `test` and `test:storybook` scripts added.
- `@storybook/addon-a11y` runs in `test: "off"` mode (the SB 8.6.x default, set explicitly) — unaudited shadcn defaults may have violations; these surface in the Storybook dev UI but do not fail CI, and are deferred to per-component build tickets.
- `@` path alias added to `.storybook/main.ts` `viteFinal` so Storybook's Vite pipeline resolves `@/lib/utils` and `@/hooks/...` imports from component files.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- `.github/workflows/components.yml` — CI runs `test:storybook` and `build-storybook` on any change under `packages/components/**`.
- Barrel surface in `src/index.ts`: commented-out export lines for every component, grouped by layer. Uncommenting a line publishes that component.

### Changed
- `components.json` — `aliases.ui` updated from `@/components/ui` to `@/components/atoms`, so future `npx shadcn add` drops new components into `atoms/` by default ("start as an atom" convention).

### Removed
- `native-select`, `calendar`, `context-menu`, `menubar`, `resizable` — not part of the intended Clarity V2 surface. Sonner covers any Toast need.
- `src/components/ui/` directory (emptied by the folder move).
- Dependencies: `react-day-picker`, `date-fns` (orphaned by Calendar removal); `react-resizable-panels` (orphaned by Resizable removal).

### Fixed
- Broken `Button` export in `src/index.ts` (previously pointed to `./components/atoms/button/button`, which did not exist after the old reference Button was removed in `6e42687`).

### Known issues
- `Chart`'s `Default` story is disabled (`tags: ["!test"]` + `parameters.docs.disable: true`). `ChartContainer` requires a `config` prop and a Recharts-compatible child tree to mount — a minimal skeleton could not be synthesised in a setup-only context. Documented in [packages/components/src/components/organisms/chart/COMPONENT.md](src/components/organisms/chart/COMPONENT.md) under the Quality checklist as an unchecked item; the per-component build ticket for Chart will re-enable it with a real render.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-04-13

Pre-history: five commits of setup work before the folder reorganisation.

### Added
- `2d2b9dc feat: added clean shadcn` — initial shadcn setup. Added `components.json`, `src/styles/globals.css`, updated `src/lib/utils.ts`, declared initial component dependencies in `package.json`.
- `947f48d feat: added all shadcn components` — 55 components added to `src/components/ui/` via `npx shadcn add`.
- `e990801 docs: comments on globals.css` — annotated `globals.css`.

### Changed
- `7068ccb fix: fresh shadcn/ui theme starter` — reset `globals.css` to a clean shadcn/ui theme starter.

### Removed
- `6e42687 chore: remove old button` — removed the pre-shadcn reference `Button` implementation at `src/components/atoms/button/button.tsx`. (Left `src/index.ts` with a dangling export, fixed in `[Unreleased]` above.)
